# pegasus_workshop
Quick workshop to illustrate example Pegasus data analysis worksflow

This workshop uses data from the [1000 Genomes project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/). I created a random subset of variants from chromosomes 20, 21, and 22, resulting in 100x fewer variants than the number of variants in the clean dataset. 

This translates to:

Number of variants | Chromosome
-------------------|------------
18,038 | 20
10,991 | 21
10,972 | 22 

All phase 3 populations are included in the dataset.

**Directories in this repository:**
*scripts* - contains the scripts that are written during the workshop

*results* - frequency files calculated with the scripts written during the workshop
<br>
*histograms* - jupyter notebooks to plot histograms of the minor allele frequencies from files in results
